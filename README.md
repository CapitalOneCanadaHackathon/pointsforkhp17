## Points For Good at the Gift the Code Hackathon - Kids Help Phone
*https://kidshelpphone.ca/*

Counselors play a critical role in Kids Help Phone's ability to field calls and chats from kids across Canada. Today, counselors are on the phone 24/7, but wait times can be hour-long. Chat is available only during evenings Wed-Mon.

As a team, we built 4 solutions to target the following levers:
1. Increasing counselors' efficiency
** Kik chatbot and counselor's chat UI that anonymizes kids' identities
** Counselor performance dashboard re-design
2. Enabling KHP to add more counselors
** "Getting to know kids" interactive slider - find articles that boys/girls of specific ages are looking at
** "Donate for chat" visualization tool - how your donations give kids more times to chat with KHP
