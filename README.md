## Points For Good at the Gift the Code Hackathon - Kids Help Phone
*https://kidshelpphone.ca/*

Counselors play a critical role in Kids Help Phone's ability to field calls and chats from kids across Canada. Today, counselors are on the phone 24/7, but wait times can be hour-long. Live chat is available only during evenings Wed-Mon.

As a team, we built 4 solutions to target the following levers:
1. Increasing counselors' efficiency
    - Kik chatbot and counselors' web-based chat interface that anonymizes kids' identities
    - Counselor performance dashboard re-design (mockups)
2. Enabling KHP to add more counselors
    - "Getting to know kids" website with interactive slider - find articles that boys/girls of specific ages are looking at
    - "Donate for chat" visualization tool in Google Sheets - how your donations give kids more times to chat with KHP
