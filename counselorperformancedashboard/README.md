# Counselor Scorecard Dashboard re-design
Today, Kids Help Phone's counselor performance dashboard is cluttered and difficult for counselors to draw actionable insights about how to improve their calls/chats with kids.

The Points for Good team re-designed the experience to:
- Simplify performance data for counsellors and team leaders to easily digest
- Implement an intuitive and easy-to-use user interface
- Help motivate KHP counselor team members by introducing goals and intra-team performance comparisons
- Encourage team members with positive performance history

Go ahead! Motivate your team!
