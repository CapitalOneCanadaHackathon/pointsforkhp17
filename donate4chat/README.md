### Donations / Fundraising 
Today, the KHP shares heartfelt stories about kids who were helped by calling KHP. Many charities employ this fundraising strategy. However, increasingly, donors want to see the direct impact of their contributions.

One way we can help donors visualize their impact is with counselor availability on live chat. Currently, there is telephone counselling 24/7, but there is only live chat counselling during the following hours. Wait times for live chat are often hour-long.
* English - 6pm-2am Wed-Sun
* French - 6pm-2am Thurs-Mon

### Milestones for Increased Helpline Availability (Reducing Missed Chats)
As discussed with KHP representatives, they would expand their counselor live chat hours in the following order:

1. Meet East Coast Demand
    - Spread out chat load during busy days by increasing English availability to 2pm-2am Wed-Sun
    - +20 hours weekly
    - Fundraising Target: $16,000/month
2. Improve West Coast Service
    - Increase coverage for West coast by increasing English availability to 2pm-4am Wed-Sun
    - +10 hours weekly
    - Fundraising Target: $28,000/month
3. Stretch Goal
    - Add coverage on lower volume days and French availability to 2pm-4am Thurs-Mon
    - +20 hours weekly
    - Fundraising Target: $38,000/month

### Next Steps
1. Implement slider widget on donation page
    - e.g. your $1000 donation can add an hour, donate with a friend ($500 each) to power another hour
2. Run a community campaign to reach milestones for increasing helpline hours/availability
    - e.g. donations thermometer on website or in campaign emails
